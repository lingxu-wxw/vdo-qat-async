/*
 * On memory ordering:
 *
 * The producer thread does: enqueue item on queue (xchg, which is
 * implicitly interlocked, then a store), memory barrier, then atomic
 * cmpxchg of the state field. The x86 architecture spec says the
 * xchg, store, lock-cmpxchg sequence cannot be reordered, but on
 * architectures using load-linked and store-conditional for the
 * cmpxchg, like AArch64, the LL can be reordered with the store, so
 * we add a barrier.
 *
 * The consumer thread, when it is running out of work, does: read
 * queue (find empty), set state, mfence, read queue again just to be
 * sure. The set-state and read-queue cannot be reordered with respect
 * to the mfence (but without the mfence, the read could be moved
 * before the set).
 *
 * The xchg and mfence impose a total order across processors, and
 * each processor sees the stores done by the other processor in the
 * required order. If the xchg happens before the mfence, the
 * consumer's "read queue again" operation will see the update. If the
 * mfence happens first, the producer's "cmpxchg state" will see its
 * updated value.
 *
 * These are the semantics implemented by memory set to WB (write-back
 * caching) mode on x86-64. So, the simple analysis is that no wakeups
 * should be missed.
 *
 * It's a little subtler with funnel queues, since one interrupted or
 * delayed enqueue operation (see the commentary in funnelQueuePut)
 * can cause another, concurrent enqueue operation to complete without
 * actually making the entry visible to the consumer. In essence, one
 * update makes no new work items visible to the consumer, and the
 * other (when it eventually completes) makes two (or more) work items
 * visible, and each one ensures that the consumer will process what
 * it has made visible.

   * pointer, which can, very rarely, result in failing to issue a
   * wakeup when needed.
   *
   * However, the gain is small, and in testing on our older "harvard"
   * class machines (Intel Xeon X5680, 3.33GHz) it was a clear win to
   * skip all of that and go right for the cmpxchg.
